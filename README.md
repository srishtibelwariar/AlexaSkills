# AlexaSkills
Below are the links of the Amazon Alexa Skills I have created and published on the Amaozn Skills store.  These skills were made using Python 2.7 while utilizing Amazon Web Services.  Though these projects are live, I still do pass updates on these skills to improve their functionality and make the VUI more conversational and easy to work with while adding more capabilities.
